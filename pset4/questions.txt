0.  JPEG - 16.7 million
    GIF - 256 colors
    PNG - 8bit holds 256; 24bit 16 million
    BMP - 8bit holds 256; 24bit can hold 16.8 million
1.  GIF supports animation
2.  "Lossless and lossy compression are terms that describe whether or not, in the compression
    of a file, all original data can be recovered when the file is uncompressed.  With lossless
    compression, every single bit of data that was originally in the file remains after the file
    is uncompressed."
3.  JPEG
4.  "First, the system modifies the filename's first character in the file's directory entry to
    signal that the file has been deleted and that the directory entry can be recycled.  Second
    the system moves all of the file's FAT clusters to the hard drive's list of free clusters.
    The actual file data is never touched."
5.  "You can intentionally overwrite the data with other data so that the original data cannot
    be recovered." 
6.  <stdint.h> is a header file that standardizes the "width" of integers (the number of bits
    used to store its value in a binary system) across platforms.
7.  The point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t is to define and utilize the
    different integer data types in C to allocate memory appropriately. CHAR, INT (positive only), INT
    (positive or negative), SHORT 
8.  1, 4, 4, 2
9.  BM (bfType are made up of the first two bytes)
10. bfSize is the size of the BITMAPFILEHEADER and biSize is the size of the BITMAPINFOHEADER
11. The BMP is drawn from the top-down, with the origin in the top-left corner
12. biBitCount (bits-per-pixel, or "the color depth")
13. It might return NULL is the computer is out of memory and therefore could not create the file.
14. Because we only want to read one element of data at a time (i.e. BITMAPFILEHEADER or BITMAPINFORHEADER)
15. 1
16. It "skips ahead" a specified number of spaces in a file.
17. It is the current position of the file pointer.
18. TODO
